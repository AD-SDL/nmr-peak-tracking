# Peak Detection with NNs

Our goal is to make a peak detection that will use the change in patterns in nearby frames and detect entire groups of related peaks (e.g., all of a doublet) instead of a single one. 
Rather than coding this complex algorithm ourselves, we will attempt to learn it automatically from data.
